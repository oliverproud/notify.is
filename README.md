Notify.is is a service that notifies you when your favourite Instagram, Twitter or GitHub username becomes available.

[Notify.is Gcloud Deployment Repository](https://github.com/oliverproud/notify.is-go)

**Todo**:
1. Fix username validation as different services require usernames to be in different formats.
2. Fix issue with GitHub check giving a false positive when the username that it checked with was of the wrong format.
3. Fix issue with Instagram check sometimes resulting in a false negative.
